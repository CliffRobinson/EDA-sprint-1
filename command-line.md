The command line is like a conversation between the user and the computer. The user asks the computer for information or instructs it to carry out actions, and the computer responds by providing the info or executing the command. 

A list of terminal commands:
1. pwd - this shows the computer directory/folder you are currently in. 
2. cd - stands for 'change directory', and moves the current directory somewhere else. 
3. ls - stands for 'list', which lists the contents of the directory. 
4. touch - creates a file in the current directory
5. rm - removes (deletes) a file
5. mkdir - creates a new directory in the current directory. 
6. rmdir - removes a directory
7. mv - moves a file to new directory, or changes its name if it is moved to the same directory. 
8. cp - copies a file
9. pushd - a different way of changing directories. It still moves you to another directory, but it also remembers the directory you came from. 
10. popd - this is the companion to popd, which takes you back to the place you used pushd in.
